<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 on Sunday, 14 April 1912.
On Monday, 15 April resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, which made it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.
In this provided visualization, we’re going to see how several factors affect the survival rate of passengers.First we see which cabin was firstly evacuated and more people were saved. Then we take ticket class which will be our main study factor. Then we will add passengers’ sex and port of Embarkation to the ticket class to see the effect on the survival rate. We will also see how number of dependents and age groups affect the probability of survival.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The whole story use:
1. Bar Graphs -In every bar chat, the y-axis shows the count of passengers, and the labels on top of the bars show the percentage or number of pessengers of the same single bar.As the whole story is focused on the people who survived or died from the accident,Bar charts easily help to see the count of people for particular category.It is easy to compare different categories of a variable.
2. Line Plots-Line plots are used for Quantitative continuous variables, which helps in finding the relationship between two variables.</p>
<p>Throughout the visualization, only three colors were used: Blue, orange, and Dark red gradient. 
Reasoning: This will help keep a consistent color encoding to make it easier to read the plots. </p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>The initial version of the visualization was shared with two co-workers. Below is the received feedback and the changes that I made based on the discussions we’ve had: 
<em> In the cabin group vs (Dead vs Survivors) visualization the relation between cabin group and the number of survivors is bit unclear.Therefore made the required changes in the latest visualization.
</em> In the Port of Embarkation visualization the comparison between the number of people dead and survived cannot be seen properly.Therefore I changed the axis to vertically compare the number of survivors and perished people and added a lable telling the count of people dead and survived respectively.
<em> In the age group visualization the number of people in significant age group is not considered which may affect the complete observation. Therefore to consider i took average number of survivors on Y axis.
</em> In the second last visualization,don't understand how the percentile of survived can be 100% when there are 1 sibling.Therefore in reply replaced labels with actual probability of survival.</p>
